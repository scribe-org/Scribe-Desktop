### Typing GUI for language learners on Windows, Mac and Linux

#### Planned port of [Scribe-iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS): see [Issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop/issues)

**Scribe-Desktop** is a language learning interface for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. The Scribe GUI provides needed information as the user types and serves as a field for input commands. Features include translation **`(beta)`**, verb conjugation and word annotation that give users the tools needed to communicate with confidence.

Scribe is fully open-source and does not collect usage data or ask for system access. Feature data is sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and stored in-app, meaning Scribe is a highly responsive experience that does not require an internet connection.

> [!NOTE]\
> The [contributing](#contributing) section has information for those interested, with the articles and presentations in [featured by](#featured-by) also being good resources for learning more about Scribe.

Also available on [iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), [Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android) (WIP) and for the data processes see [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data).

Check out Scribe's [architecture diagrams](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of the organization including our applications, services and processes. It depicts the projects that [Scribe](https://github.com/scribe-org) is developing as well as the relationships between them and the external systems with which they interact.s

Design related issues are marked with the [`design`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adesign) label.

### Data Edits [`⇧`](#contents)

> [!NOTE]\
> Please see the [Wikidata and Scribe Guide](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/WIKIDATAGUIDE.md) for an overview of [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and how Scribe uses it.

Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar JSON files as they are sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits can be discussed and the queries themselves will be changed and ran before an update. If there is a problem with one of the files, then the fix should be made on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and not on Scribe. Feel free to let us know that edits have been made by [opening a data issue](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=data&template=data_wikidata.yml) or contacting us in the [issues for Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues) and we'll be happy to integrate them!

<a id="environment-setup"></a>

# Environment Setup [`⇧`](#contents)

Those new to coding or wanting to develop their skills are more than welcome to contribute! The general steps to setting up a development environment are:

1. First and foremost, please see the suggested IDE setup in the dropdown below to make sure that your editor is ready for development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> <details><summary>Suggested IDE setup</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> VS Code
>
> Install the following extensions:
>
> - [qwtel.sqlite-viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer)
> - [streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
> - [rust-lang.rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
>
> </p>
> </details>

2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [Scribe-Desktop repo](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Scribe-Desktop.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) 🔑
>
> </p>
> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scribe-Desktop.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd Scribe-Desktop
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (Scribe-Desktop repository)

3. Install Rust and Cargo:

- For Linux and macOS:

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. You can find more details in the [official Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

- For Windows:

Download and run [rustup-init.exe](https://rustup.rs/). Follow the instructions in the installer. For more details, visit the [Rust Windows installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

After installation, you may need to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect. Verify the installation by running:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

4. (Suggested) Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and its hooks to check for and correct common errors in commits:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
# pre-commit run --all-files
```

5. Run the following to spin up a local copy of the Scribe-Desktop GUI:

```bash
cd scribe
cargo build
cargo run --bin scribe
```

6. You may need to give your terminal or IDE permission for your keyboard strokes to be read
   - You may also need to restart the application and then run `cargo run --bin scribe` again

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to contact the team in the [Desktop room on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ScribeDesktop:matrix.org) if you're having problems getting your environment setup!
